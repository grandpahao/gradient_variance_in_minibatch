# gradient_variance_in_minibatch

This project tends to monitor the variance of gradient in minibatch in MNIST.

It is awful to build any self-designed tensorflow project from scratch!!!!

Thanks to the magic function for jacobian matrix computation at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/parallel_for/gradients.py#L28.
